On or about this time, Mr. Musk and Mr. Hassabis met at SpaceX’s \\nfactory in Hawthorne, California where Mr. Musk and Mr. Hassabis discussed the greatest threats \\nfacing society.

Mr. Musk was deeply troubled by this development. He believed (and still does) that in the \\nhands of a closed, for-profit company like Google, AGI poses a particularly acute and noxious \\ndanger to humanity. In 2014, it was already difficult enough to compete with Google in its core \\nbusinesses.
